```
- **cd mapline**

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install psutil requests tkintermapview matplotlib
```
- **Linux users may need:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
3. **Run the application**
```bash
python Mapline.py
```

## üìñ How to Use

### First Launch
1. Open the application
2. Click "Refresh Now" in the Connections tab
3. Watch as your network connections populate the list
4. Explore different tabs to see various visualizations

### Understanding the Interface
| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Connections** | List all active outbound connections with filters |
| **Map View** | Geographic visualization of connection paths |
| **Statistics** | Charts and analytics about your connections |
| **Grouping** | Connections organized by categories |
| **Bandwidth** | Real-time traffic monitoring |

### Key Actions
- Double-click any connection for detailed information
- Use filters to focus on specific processes or countries
- Toggle auto-refresh for continuous monitoring
- Switch themes between dark and light mode
- Start bandwidth monitoring to track data usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
Edit these settings in the script for customization:

```python
REFRESH_INTERVAL = 8.0          # Auto-refresh interval (seconds)
MAX_GEO_WORKERS = 10            # Parallel geolocation requests
MAX_DNS_WORKERS = 10            # Parallel DNS resolution threads
BANDWIDTH_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 2.0 # Bandwidth update frequency
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### üîí Security & Monitoring
- **Threat Detection** - Identify suspicious outbound connections and potential malware
- **Network Auditing** - Monitor all external connections for security compliance
- **Data Exfiltration Prevention** - Detect unauthorized data transfers
- **Incident Response** - Investigate security incidents and breach attempts
- **Compliance Monitoring** - Ensure data sovereignty and regulatory requirements
- **Unknown Process Detection** - Identify unfamiliar processes making network calls
- **Geographic Threat Analysis** - Flag connections to high-risk countries

## üåç How It Works

### 1. Connection Discovery
- Uses `psutil.net_connections()` to scan all active TCP/UDP connections
- Filters for outbound connections only (remote addresses)
- Excludes localhost and internal network connections
- Captures process ID (PID) and process name for each connection

### 2. Data Enrichment
- **Geolocation**: Queries ip-api.com to get country, city, coordinates, and ISP
- **DNS Resolution**: Performs reverse DNS lookups to find domain names
- **Protocol Detection**: Maps port numbers to service names (HTTP, SSH, etc.)
- **Caching**: Stores geolocation and DNS results to avoid repeated API calls

### 3. Parallel Processing
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent geolocation requests
- Processes multiple IP addresses simultaneously (up to 10 threads)
- Implements DNS resolution in parallel for faster results

### 4. Visualization
- **Map View**: Uses tkintermapview to display connections on OpenStreetMap
- **Charts**: Uses matplotlib for statistical charts and graphs
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuously refreshes data at configurable intervals

### 5. Bandwidth Monitoring
- Tracks connection duration and estimated data transfer
- Calculates transfer rates using system-wide network statistics
- Updates bandwidth display every 2 seconds during active monitoring


## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### Current Limitations
- Bandwidth monitoring provides estimates rather than precise measurements
- Some connections may show "Unknown" for geolocation data
- Map may load slowly with poor internet connections
- Process names may not resolve for all connections

### Planned Features
- **Export functionality** - Save connection data to CSV/JSON
- **Historical logging** - Track connections over time
- **Custom alerts** - Notifications for specific connection patterns
- **More geolocation providers** - Fallback options for better coverage
- **Enhanced filtering** - More advanced search and filter options
- **Network capture** - Integrate with packet capture for detailed analysis

### Recent Fixes
- Improved error handling for geolocation API failures
- Better memory management for long-running sessions
- Fixed duplicate connection entries in lists
- Enhanced DNS resolution with timeout handling
- Improved map marker clustering for dense regions

## ‚ùì FAQ

### üîß Common Questions
**Q: Why are some connections missing geolocation data?**
- Some IP addresses cannot be geolocated
- The geolocation service may be temporarily unavailable
- Corporate or cloud IPs often have limited location data

**Q: How accurate is the bandwidth monitoring?**
- Provides estimates based on system-wide network statistics
- Best for identifying high-usage connections rather than precise measurements
- Updates every 2 seconds when monitoring is active

**Q: Can I use Mapline on a server without GUI?**
- Requires graphical interface for the map and charts
- Consider using command-line alternatives for headless servers

**Q: Is my data private?**
- Only IP addresses are sent to ip-api.com for geolocation
- No personal data or connection content is transmitted
- All processing happens locally on your machine

**Q: Why can't I see any connections?**
- Ensure you have active outbound internet connections
- Some systems may require administrator privileges
- Check if your firewall is blocking the application

**Q: The map isn't loading, what should I do?**
- Verify your internet connection is working
- Check if your firewall allows map tile downloads
- Try refreshing the map or restarting the application

**Q: How often should I refresh the connections?**
- For general monitoring: 8-second intervals are sufficient
- For detailed analysis: Use manual refresh as needed
- For bandwidth monitoring: 2-second intervals provide good detail

**Q: Can I export the connection data?**
- Currently available in the application interface only
- Export functionality is planned for future versions
- You can take screenshots of the data displays

**Q: Does Mapline work on all operating systems?**
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with GUI
- Requires Python 3.8+ and internet connection
- Linux users may need to install python3-tk separately
