# Mapline

Mapline is a Python desktop tool that helps you see all the connections your computer makes to the internet in real time. It shows a live map of where your data is going and tells you which programs are responsible for each connection. This makes it easy to understand your network activity and spot any unusual or unexpected traffic. It’s simple to use and gives you a clear visual of your computer’s online activity.
